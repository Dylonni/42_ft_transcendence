access to database is to be restricted to specific department. One person is to be considered "admin" and has all access to DB while it exists (including handling the backup policy)
maybe also allow this person to delete an account? in case of "violation"

minimal access may be granted, for viewing only, to other members pertaining to the dpt, with individual creds

=> HOW TO ENSURE THERE IS NO POSSIBLE CHANGES TO DATABASE FROM ADMIN ??

employees will not use the users' data outside of the processing scope determined by the PIAs and the Record of Processing activities (RoPA = registre des activites de traitement
they are not to share creds, or let any one or any entity outside the Transcendence team access/modify/retrieve the users' data
